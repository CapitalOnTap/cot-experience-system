# Personality

Our personality establishes the foundation of the Atlassian brand. It is a product of our mission, and a reflection of our culture, values, and promise to customers. We make sure that these traits come through in all of our customer-facing communications and content.

We take a stand. Not everyone will agree with everything we say – and that's ok. We state our position and back it up. We are clear and direct, acknowledge the hard truths… but are not cocky.

We have our point of view, but don’t belittle our competitors or people who don't share it.

We are humble. We know we’re a team that makes awesome software, but we're balanced. We acknowledge when we fail, admit it, embrace it, and grow from it.
